I have developed an interactive Android application called "Ask Me", which integrates with a Gemini agent using Dialogflow CX. This app allows users to engage in dynamic conversations, displaying AI-generated responses seamlessly.

I set up and configured the agent within Dialogflow CX and integrated it into my Android application. The app processes user queries, sends them to the agent, and retrieves intelligent responses, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. My goal is to make AI-driven conversations more intuitive and accessible through this integration.
